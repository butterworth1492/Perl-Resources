# Summary:
#   It is often prudent to include netstat dumps as part of automatic Metasploit
#   post-exploitation loot that is collected upon establishing a callback.
#   This script sifts through the large amount of information in the loot file(s),
#   scrapes out the netstat information, analyzes each individual connection, 
#   and prints out information that can be useful when building a target package.
#   The output is formatted to allow for easy parsing.

# Usage:
#  perl metasploit-netstat-ports.pl <file with netstat output> <port of interest>

# Output:
#  1. A list of every client that connected to a remote resource on that port
#  2. A list of every server that accepted a connection on that port
#  3. The number of times each client connected or each server accepted
#     a connection on that port
#  4. A breakdown of the top 5 noisiest clients and servers talking on that
#     port
