Some useful PERL resources.

Metasploit-Netstat:
  It is often prudent to include netstat dumps as part of automatic Metasploit
  post-exploitation loot that is collected upon establishing a callback.
  This script sifts through the large amount of information in the loot file(s),
  scrapes out the netstat information, analyzes each individual connection, 
  and prints out information that can be very useful when building a target 
  package.  The output is formatted to allow for easy parsing.
