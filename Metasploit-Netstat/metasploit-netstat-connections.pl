#Summary:
#  It is often prudent to include netstat dumps as part of automatic Metasploit
#  post-exploitation loot that is collected upon establishing a callback.
#  This script sifts through the large amount of information in the loot file(s),
#  scrapes out the netstat information, analyzes each individual connection, 
#  and prints out information that can be useful when building a target package.
#  The output is formatted to allow for easy parsing.

#Usage:
# perl metasploit-netstat-connections.pl <file with netstat output>

#Output:
# 1. A list of every connection made.
# 2. Both endpoints, client and server, that participated in the connection
# 3. The client and server ports used in the connection
